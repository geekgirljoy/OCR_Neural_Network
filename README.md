OCR is a practical example of Optical Character Recognition using [FANN](https://github.com/bukka/php-fann). While this example is limited and does make mistakes, the concepts illustrated by OCR can be applied to a more robust stacked network that uses feature extraction and convolution layers to recognize text of any font in any size image.

**At the end of this series of tutorials you will be able to build Neural Networks using PHP that can read characters from images! I will be giving you actual working code!**

OCR is a practical example of Optical Character Recognition using [FANN](https://github.com/bukka/php-fann). While this example is limited and does make mistakes, the concepts illustrated by OCR can be applied to a more robust stacked network that uses feature extraction and convolution layers to recognize text of any font in any size image.

As mentioned this will be a series of posts so that I don‚Äôt overwhelm you guys with too much information all at once and so I don‚Äôt have to sit here and type [ad infinitum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ad_infinitum) (infinite recursion).

üòõ

[OCR (Optical Character Recognition)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optical_character_recognition) isn‚Äôt exactly a new subject but surprisingly its something that few computer scientists have actual experience building! Further, any examples you see are descriptions at best that frequently ‚Äúdevolve‚Äù into a math lesson that ultimately glosses over practical application and important implementation details!

Don‚Äôt get me wrong, I love math but that isn‚Äôt required to start learning. The FANN Library will act as an abstraction layer so we can focus on our data and objectives and not complex differential equations.

Additionally all the code will be thoroughly documented and intentionally simplified and referenced so that even a student with minimal experience can benefit. I happen to believe that Neural Networks are complex enough already, and the more people who know how to build and deploy these systems the faster we can find solutions to the most horrible problems we face as a species (currently incurable diseases, famine, wars over resources, the global energy crisis) need I go on?

So, I am going to provide you with the tools and basic knowledge of how to build POWERFUL artificial intelligence systems and deploy them to cloud servers, not to shabby eh? üòâ

Not so you can go get rich building games and businesses (which you could easily do and that‚Äôs fine) but it is my very real hope that at lease some of you can apply these tools to help make the world a better place, start in your own community today!

In a very surreal way I am reminded of a lyric from the song [‚ÄúI‚Äôd Love to Change the World‚Äù by Ten Years After](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyaFeDlJJAk)

*‚ÄúI‚Äôd love to change the world, But I don‚Äôt know what to do, So I‚Äôll leave it up to you-ooo-ooo‚Äù*

Its rather haunting in how true that actually is, isn‚Äôt it?

If you do happen to start a business using these tools and techniques or you simply appreciate the content that I create please support me on [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/user?u=3969727) and please share this project with your followers, friends and coworkers on social media.

Now to begin you will need an environment to build your [ANN (Artificial Neural Network)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_neural_network), rather than reproduce the steps here you can follow this tutorial I wrote to get setup to work: [Getting started with Neural Networks using the FANN library, PHP and C9.io](https://geekgirljoy.wordpress.com/2016/07/12/getting-started-with-neural-networks-using-the-fann-library-php-and-c9-io/)

Go follow the setup process and come back, I‚Äôll wait. üòâ

So, in order for a Neural Network to be useful it needs a ‚Äúproblem space‚Äù (basically the thing we want it to learn or do) and a ‚Äútraining set‚Äù (examples of data similar to the data the ANN will encounter in the ‚Äúproblem space‚Äù but which already has a known value or solution). In this case, because we are teaching the ANN to read characters from images, we need a set of images with alpha-numeric characters in them.

Further, before getting started we have to make sure that we don‚Äôt violate the licensing of any training set we use so to keep things simple for this tutorial I will show you how to generate your own basic training data programmatically.

Because the training set will be generated programmatically rather than by hand we are excluding hand written characters from this example ANN however with the use of additional training sets and [convolution layers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convolutional_neural_network) you could add that functionality to this neural network, however again, I want this example to be understandable by everyone.

So with that being said, lets begin by generating the training set of images!

We can use the [PHP GD library](http://php.net/manual/en/book.image.php)  which is a library used to manipulate images.

The GD Lib is almost always installed (compiled into php) by your host for you already and you probably have used it in the past (even if you didn‚Äôt realize it) for your other projects so I wont cover it in too much detail, suffice it to say its pretty east to get access to.

The images in our simple training set will be 10 pixels wide and 16 pixels high.

(10*16 = 160 pixels per image)

And in this example I will use only black and white for simplicity, white will be 1 and black will be 0. It‚Äôs completely arbitrary and you could reverse the colors if you wanted but white text on black seems to be high contrast so I decided to use that.

It‚Äôs also worth noting the importance of understanding that fundamentally there is no reason why you can‚Äôt use floating point values and represent the entire color spectrum or just gray scale.

Switching to a float would allow you to encode more information as a gradient however this will increase complexity of your ANN and you may require more hidden neurons, layers or both in addition to increased training epochs. In reality you would likely be MUCH better off adding [convolutions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convolutional_neural_network) and building a more robust ANN.

This ANN does not use convolution layers and will make a few mistakes from time to time, my point is that this is a simplified, stripped down, easy to understand example however with a little work you could build this into a very robust OCR ANN.

So now lets look at a sample training image as well as dive into the code to generate them!

## generate_training_images.php

```php
<?php

/*
    NewImage( 
	          (int)$char, 
	          (mixed)$curr_image, 
			  (int)$x , 
			  (int)$y, 
			  (file resource)$logfile
			);
	
	Description: 
	
	This function actually creates the images. 
	
	It is written with an iterative process in mind where more than a single training image (batch creation) would be generated however a single image can be generated if you prefer.
	
	I have created the GenerateTrainingImages() function that will call this function for you so you *could*
	ignore this function but its the one that does the real work. 
		
	$char uses the chr() function to convert the number passed to an ASCII character.
	
	$curr_image is a mixed type variable used to name the image that is being generated. In this
	case (i.e how I used it in GenerateTrainingImages()) I have used it as a number so it's easy to 
	iterate over the image files using a simple for loop to programmatically create the images we
    need however you could create an array of strings or chars and use those instead however that is
	not quite as simple as the implementation shown here.
	
	$x & $y are direct pass-through variables for the x & y coordinate placement variables as defined
	in the imagestring() function documentation: http://php.net/manual/en/function.imagestring.php
    
	The main reason why I made them "pass-through" rather than hard coding them in the NewImage()
    function is simply that you may want to vary or stagger the placement of the character within the images.
	
	$logfile is a file resource variable that points to the file that will log results of generating
	the training images. You may want to use this file in later steps or for reference. Please note that 
	NewImage() does not open its own access to the file so you will need to open the file resource yourself
	prior to calling NewImage().
	
	
	Example NewImage() Usage:
	
	// Create $logfile resource
	$logfile = fopen("images/generate_images.log", "w") or die("Error: Unable to open: " . $logfile . '. Ending program.');
	
	// This will create a b/w image of an exclamation mark(!) named 0.png
	NewImage(33, 0, 1, 0, $logfile);
	
	// Close log file 
    fclose($logfile);

It looks like a lot of code, I know! If you are feeling overwhelmed delete my comments and you will see that the actual code is quite short and very simple.
If you run this code the following things will happen:

    1. A sub-folder called ‚Äòimages‚Äô will be created for you where you ran generate_training_images.php.
    2. 94 training images will be generated for you and saved in the images sub-folder.
    3. A log file named ‚Äògenerate_images.log‚Äô will be created.

At this point we are ready to use these images to create the training set that the Neural Network will use. 

Here is our newly minted [set of training images](https://github.com/geekgirljoy/OCR_Neural_Network/tree/master/Basic/images).

Next we will convert the training images into training data that the OCR ANN can use to learn the letters, numbers and symbols in our training images.

    This algorithm works by iterating over an image pixel by pixel and evaluating the RBG color values of a pixel in an image and assigning a single numerical value to represent the color of the pixel.
    
    White pixels will be encoded as 1 and black pixels will be 0.
    
    Counts begin with 0.
    
    We proceed from the top left corner of the image which for descriptive purposes could be referred to as $row 0, and $col 0 (0,0) and the bottom most right pixel would be the last processed and would be (15,9). 
    
    All columns on a given row will be encoded prior to proceeding to the next row.
  
    As it is currently written the images should be in a sub-folder named 'images' and the image set should 
    be named from 0.png to the last image in the set e.g. 93.png or other if you changed the code that generates
    the training images.

### If you run this code the following things will happen: 

    1. Each image will be examined pixel by pixel and based on it's color, encoded as a 0 (black) or 1 (white). As mentioned in the previously mentioned, I chose this encoding scheme because I wanted to use high contrast images with the text being white and the background being black, adjust as necessary.
    2. Each pattern of 1's and 0's will be assigned a floating point value between 0 and 1.
    3. All the encoded patterns and their values will be saved to a training data file for later use as inputs for the ANN.

Now comes the real fun! In my next post we will train the OCR Neural Network and take it for a test drive! üòõ
